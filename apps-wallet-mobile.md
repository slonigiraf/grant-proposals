## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Our project focuses on the development of mobile compatibility for the [Polkadot apps wallet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer), an official interface to the Polkadot ecosystem that is currently unoptimized for mobile use (see Figure 1). With the understanding that mobile traffic makes up a significant percentage of all web traffic, we see a need for a version of the wallet that can be easily accessed and navigated on mobile phones. This modification will enable us to tap into the potential new users who have been deterred by the wallet's current limitations.

This project is an integral part of the Polkadot ecosystem. By creating a mobile-optimized version of the Polkadot apps wallet, we will increase the overall accessibility and usability of the ecosystem. Our mobile-friendly interface will provide a seamless user experience, opening up the entire ecosystem to a broader user base and facilitating greater integration and interaction with the Substrate framework and Kusama network.

Our team is deeply invested in the development of a parachain designed specifically for use on mobile devices. With the increasing prevalence of mobile web use, we recognize the urgent need for a mobile web version of the Polkadot apps wallet. This development is crucial for our parachain's success as it will provide users with seamless, efficient, and user-friendly access to our offerings. Through this project, we aim to align the Polkadot ecosystem's accessibility with current mobile usage trends, ensuring the wide adoption and practical usability of our mobile-centric parachain. Our team's passion and expertise in mobile blockchain applications make us committed to seeing this project come to fruition, ushering in a new era of convenience and accessibility for Polkadot, Substrate, and Kusama users.

### Ecosystem Fit

The Polkadot and Kusama networks use a [sophisticated governance mechanism](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance) to roll out blockchain updates. This mechanism involves voting on referenda and council decisions, and a Technical Committee that has the power to fast-track proposals. Similar ideas [underlie](https://polkadot.network/blog/polkadao-is-live/) the decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) within these ecosystems.

Historically, bribery has been [viewed negatively](https://decrypt.co/7102/live-at-eth-ny-its-vitalik-buterin) within the blockchain community, so lobbying is not a common practice in blockchain-based dApps. We aim to fill this gap by creating a system that mimics how laws were traditionally created.

We believe that different parachains and DAOs could benefit from our project, as it would add new governance functionality to their voting processes. The code for our GIRAF project will also be used extensively in our main project, [Slonigiraf](https://github.com/slonigiraf/whitepaper/blob/main/slon/ENG.md), which is a tool for creating digital recommendation letters and diplomas. It will be used for the coordination of various companies and educational organizations in determining the skills to be assessed and the appropriate methods of assessment for those skills.
