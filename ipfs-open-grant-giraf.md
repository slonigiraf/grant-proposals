# Project Description

Laws are a fundamental part of human civilization and are generally understood to be a set of instructions or rules that people have agreed to follow. Examples of laws include the Bill of Rights in the United States, the Wikipedia article on DNA, history schoolbook, and the balance of a specific bitcoin wallet. However, the exact definition of the term "law" is a matter of debate. In this document, we will use the above definition for the purposes of our discussion.

The process of lawmaking is closely tied to economic activity. For example, politicians in the United States often rely on [funding from lobbyists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying_in_the_United_States) to run for office and push for legislation that benefits those lobbyists. Similarly, editors of Wikipedia articles may spend their valuable time and resources [fighting for the content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) of an article, and the author of a schoolbook or a publishing house may receive funding from individuals or groups who wish to promote [their point of view](https://meduza.io/feature/2019/10/21/ministerstvo-prosveschenie). In the case of Bitcoin, miners [are paid](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) for their work in changing the balances of wallets. In some cases, foreign countries may even intervene in the lawmaking process of another country [with money](https://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN2450753720071024).

It can be argued that the practice of buying and selling laws, also known as lobbying, is a global norm that is generally accepted and serves as an important tool for creating consensus in society. This in turn can lead to economic well-being, as seen in the United States with its well-established lobbying practices.

**We plan to build a system on top of IPFS/Filecoin** that allows the **creation and lobbying of laws** in groups if different size: from small communities to a size of a country. It will be used in groups that lack legislation due to the small size of a group or in bigger societies to speedup the creation of a public consensus.

The proposed system would involve the use of a database to store entries for each law, with each entry containing:

- A unique identifier for the law, such as a serial number.
- A hash of the text of the law, which could be generated using a system such as the [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/).
- The amount of money that was used for a lobbying when the law was created.

The use of hashes for the text of laws would allow for the efficient storage of laws using a system like IPFS/Filecoin, while also providing protection against unauthorized changes to the text of the laws.

Our system will also include the user interface for such a database.

## Value

The use of Filecoin in the GIRAF system could potentially lead to increased demand for Filecoin storage and raise awareness of the platform. The GIRAF project could help showcase the potential uses of Filecoin and the benefits of decentralized systems. By providing a successful example of a decentralized system in action, the GIRAF project could help raise awareness of Filecoin and potentially attract more users and developers to the platform.

As a new project, we are faced with the challenge of creating a user experience that is simple and intuitive for people who may not be familiar with our system. We are working hard to design a user interface that is easy to understand and use, even for those with no prior knowledge or experience with decentralized systems or blockchain technology.

## Deliverables

<!-- Please describe in details what your final deliverable for this project will be. Include a specification of the project and what functionality the software will deliver when it is finished. -->

## Development Roadmap

<!-- Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section). -->

<!-- For each milestone, please describe: -->
<!-- - The software functionality that we can expect after the completion of each milestone. This should be detailed enough that it can be used to ensure that the software meets the specification you outlined in the Deliverables. -->
<!-- - How many people will be working on each milestone and their roles -->
<!-- - The amount of funding required for each milestone -->
<!-- - How much time this milestone will take to achieve (using real dates) -->

## Total Budget Requested

<!--Sum up the total requested budget across all milestones, and include that figure here. Also, please include a budget breakdown to specify how you are planning to spend these funds. -->

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

<!-- Specify your team's long-term plans to maintain this software and upgrade it over time. -->
